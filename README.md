# welcome to my github profile

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Professionally I am a data engineer, but there isn't anything in this account that's related to that (yet, anyway). It's mostly just random stuff I make in my spare time. Most of the code you'll find on here will be in Python (my favorite programming language) or HTML/CSS/JS.

If you want to see my best project on here, I recommend you check out [Sonic OC Bot](https://github.com/BenShoeman/SonicOCBot). It contains the code for a Twitter bot I made ([@SonicOCBot](https://twitter.com/sonicocbot)) that randomly generates Sonic the Hedgehog characters and fanfics. Mostly nonsense, but it's all in good fun :)

Planning on using this repo to host a personal site too -- that is in progress!
